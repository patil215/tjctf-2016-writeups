CTFs (Capture-the-Flag) are competitions where contestants must solve a series of challenges, each of which contains a flag (typically a hidden string of text). The challenges range from web exploits to reverse engineering to cryptography. TJCTF is one such competition created by the [TJ Computer Security Club](https://github.com/tjcsec).

We are Steam Locomotive, a team of high school students from the [Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, TX](http://www.lasahighschool.org/). We are:
* Ehsan Asdar - [ehsanmasdar](https://github.com/ehsanmasdar)
* Michael Barre - [meeees](https://github.com/meeees)
* Ashwin Gupta - [Shwinn](https://github.com/Shwinn)
* Neil Patil - [patil215](https://github.com/patil215)
* John - [Jumboperson](https://github.com/jumboperson)

During TJCTF, we accumulated a total of UNKNOWN points and finished in 3rd place.
