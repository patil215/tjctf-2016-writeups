## Problem ##
Sometimes I miss that land of bliss. [Outbox.zip](Outbox.zip)

## Answer ##

### Overview ###
Download a million programs to open random file types and find a document with the flag.

### Details ###
We are given a file, Outbox.zip. When we unzip it, we get an email backup file (.eml). I downloaded UUDWin, which extracted the contents of the email backup. From this we received a backup.bkf file. Using nt5backup, I was able to recover 2 Documents and Setting Folders. Both of them were very similar, but in one of them flag.doc was significantly larger than flag.doc in the other folder. After opening the larger flag.doc, the flag was inside an image there.

Here is the image:
